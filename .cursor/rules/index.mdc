# Project Rules Index

This document outlines the structure and hierarchy of rules for the Greek Vases project.

## Rule Hierarchy

1.  **Global STRM Rules:** Apply first (defined externally).
2.  **Project Rules (`project.mdc`):** Define project-wide conventions and override global rules where necessary.
3.  **Component/Module Rules (e.g., `components/GreekVases.mdc`):** Specific rules for particular parts of the codebase (to be added as needed).

## Documentation Structure

- Follow standard Markdown conventions for documentation files (.md, .mdc).
- Code comments should be in English.
- UI text language depends on project requirements (currently Polish for instructions, English for general UI elements like counters).

## Key Files

- `project.mdc`: General project rules and technology stack.
- `README.md`: High-level project overview, setup, and controls.
- `.todo/`: Task management files (if used).

## General Guidelines

- Maintain consistency with existing code patterns.
- Prioritize clarity and maintainability.
- Adhere to the specified language rules (Polish for chat, English for code/docs).
